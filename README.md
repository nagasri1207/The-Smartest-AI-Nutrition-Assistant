## 🧩 Problem Statement

In an era of information overload, many individuals struggle to find reliable and personalized nutrition advice. Generic diet plans fail to consider personal health goals, lifestyle, dietary restrictions, and cultural food habits. This leads to confusion, unsustainable habits, and failure to achieve wellness objectives like weight management or improved fitness.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

An AI agent trained using IBM Watsonx.ai that delivers reliable, document-based answers about nutrition. By using trusted sources like the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), and employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it ensures users receive grounded, easy-to-understand, and personalized nutritional guidance.
